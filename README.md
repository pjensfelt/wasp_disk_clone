# wasp_disk_clone

The scripts in here are used to make copies of the WASP external drive with Linux installed. They come in two version, one for PC and one for Mac. Mac requires that the EFI partiion is hfs+.

The general setup of the disk is 
* EFI
* 200GB /
* 16GB swap
* 200GB exFat with label "EXFAT" for large file exchange on all platforms but need to install support for exfat
* 40GB fat32 with label "FAT32" for data exchange on all platforms without changes

## Prepare the disk to be cloned

First ensure which disk to clone
```
sudo fdisk -l
```

The disk is partitioned using GPT. The sections below show the exact layout for the two disk. Don't ask why they are not identical excet for the first partition...

### Mac disk
```
Disk /dev/sdb: 465,8 GiB, 500107861504 bytes, 976773167 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 33553920 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 6D907A03-5F5C-4DD9-AFDE-7294DF7DBE93

/dev/sdb5  454035456 873465855 419430400  200G Linux filesystem

Partition table entries are not in disk order.

### PC disk
```
Disk /dev/sdb: 465,8 GiB, 500107861504 bytes, 976773167 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

Device         Start       End   Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdb1       2048    677887    675840  330M EFI System
/dev/sdb2     677888 420108287 419430400  200G Linux filesystem
/dev/sdb3  420108288 453662719  33554432   16G Linux swap

/dev/sdb5  873093120 956979199  83886080 Â  40G Microsoft basic data

Partition table entries are not in disk order.
```

### Compress
Shrink the / partition to a almost minimum so that we hve the smallest possible amount to copy. With Ubuntu 16.04 and all the software installed for Module 1 of the Autonomous Systems course, this is roughly 13GB. I shrunk / to 16GB.

### Store data
Assume below that it is /dev/sdb

I will also assume that we name some files with suffic PC or Mac. PC in the example below

#### Backup the partition table
```
sudo sgdisk --backup=backup_PC.sgdisk /dev/sdb
```
Generates lots of warnings

Make sure that all partitions are unmounted (not sure if they could be at this point)
```
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo umount /dev/sdb2
sudo umount /dev/sdb4
sudo umount /dev/sdb5
```

#### Store the UUIDs
```
sudo blkid /dev/sdb > uuid-sdb.txt
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1 > uuid-sdb1.txt
sudo blkid /dev/sdb2 > uuid-sdb2.txt
sudo blkid /dev/sdb3 > uuid-sdb3.txt
sudo blkid /dev/sdb4 > uuid-sdb4.txt
sudo blkid /dev/sdb5 > uuid-sdb5.txt
```

#### Store the partition data (that we need to keep)
```
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=sdb1_PC.img bs=4096
sudo dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=sdb2_PC.img bs=4096
```
The first of these should take about 5s and the second about 180s with a read speed of about 100MB/s

## Make a new disk with script

Run the script create_wasp_disk.sh

```
sudo ./create_wasp_disk.sh ../WASP_Disk_Master_PC/ /dev/sdb PC
```


## Make a new disk by hand

Go to the directory where the cloned partitions are (also where this file most likely is)

### First ensure which disk to clone into
```
sudo fdisk -l
```

Assume below that it is /dev/sdb


### Make sure the partitions are unmounted
```
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo umount /dev/sdb2
sudo umount /dev/sdb4
sudo umount /dev/sdb5
```

### Restore the GPT partition table
```
sudo sgdisk -g --load-backup=backup__PC.sgdisk /dev/sdb  
```
The option -g is needed if the disk was using another partition table than GPT  
You may need to plug out and in again for it to understand that it has been changed  

```
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
sudo umount /dev/sdb2
sudo umount /dev/sdb4
sudo umount /dev/sdb5
```

### Restore the data to the disks
**NOTE:** Unless you want to change **all** references to the UUID:s that exists somewhere in the system it is safer just to make sure that the UUID is restored exactly as they were on the master disk. This has some obvious shortcoming when it comes to being able to plug in two of these disks in the same computer...

```
sudo mkswap -U `cat uuid-sdb3.txt | sed -n '/sdb3/s/.*UUID=\"\([^\"]*\)\".*/\1/p'` /dev/sdb3
sudo mkfs.exfat -n EXFAT /dev/sdb4
sudo mkdosfs -F 32 -n FAT32 -I /dev/sdb5
sudo dd if=sdb1_PC.img of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4096
sudo dd if=sdb2_PC.img of=/dev/sdb2 bs=4096
```

### Grow the / partition to fill the whole space
**Warning this assumes a very specific geometry of the disk!!!!!**
#### For PC
```
sudo parted /dev/sdb resizepart 2 420108287s
sleep 2
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2 
sleep 2
sudo resize2fs /dev/sdb2 
```
#### For Mac
```
sudo parted /dev/sdb resizepart 2 420481023s
sleep 2
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/sdb2 
sleep 2
sudo resize2fs /dev/sdb2 
```
